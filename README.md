# mu

A Muslim app platform

## Overview

Mu is a Muslim app platform that provides a simple set of building blocks for life. It was born out of a frustration with existing services not catering to Muslims. Most tech platforms create addictive behaviours through their algorithms. The intention is to create a separate system that fixes this. Part of the goal is to focus on things like prayer times, the quran in english, etc. Other parts are related to interests like reading news, open source activity and crypto.

## Apps

The current list of apps:

- **Chat** - General knowledge AI chat
- **News** - News headlines and market data
- **Pray** - Islamic prayer times
- **Reminder** - The holy Quran in English
- **Watch** - Watch YouTube videos
- **Work** - For the sake of Allah 
  
## Dependencies

- Go toolchain

## Usage

Download source

```bash
go install mu.dev/cmd/mu@latest
```

Run it

## Admin

```

## PWA

Mu operates as a progressive web app. The main app can be installed just like a native app. 

Caching and offline mode is still a WIP.
